Price Elasticity & Discount Optimization 

Python, Statsmodels
– Conducted price elasticity analysis on over 149,000 cafe transactions using log-log regression models to assess
demand sensitivity for 15+ product categories.
– Identified highly elastic products (Elasticity ¡ -1) suitable for aggressive promotions and inelastic items where
discounts reduced profits, optimizing pricing strategy.
– Documented the methodology and findings in a GitHub repository, using Seaborn for heatmaps to visualize peak
sales hours (Weekday × Hour) to guide staffing and inventory decisions
